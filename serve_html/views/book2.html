                        <b>About: </b> The Giving Tree considers the nature of altruism and the obligation to give of oneself in a relationship. Once there was a tree who loved a little boy. Every day the boy would come to the tree to eat her apples, swing from her branches, or slide down her trunkâ€¦ and the tree was happy. But as the boy grew older he began to want more from the tree, and the tree gave and gave.
